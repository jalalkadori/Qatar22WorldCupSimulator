⚽ Group Stage Standings Simulator
Technology used: PHP • HTML/CSS • MySQL
Project type: Web application

Overview:
This PHP web app simulates the ranking of 4 teams competing in a group stage, such as in the FIFA World Cup. Users can input match results (wins, draws, goals) and instantly view an updated table that reflects:

Match points

Goal differences

Team rankings

Tie-breaker rules (as in real tournaments)

Purpose:
To practice PHP logic, dynamic table updates, and simulate real-world sports rules using a clean, interactive interface.

What I learned:
✔ Structuring dynamic data in PHP
✔ Handling conditional logic for ranking teams
✔ Enhancing user experience with form-based inputs
✔ Displaying real-time data without refreshing the page (using a touch of JavaScript)
